# Blade-JIT

A JIT compiler for the Blade programming language. The goal is to replace the current BladeVM as the standard runtime.

A few things have been changed, and they will automatically cascade to the parent project when Blade JIT finally replaces it as the standard runtime.

For an overview of what changes are coming, see [the CHANGES README](./CHANGES.md).
